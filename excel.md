# Registering Excel Models in Dojo

To aid in running models written in Excel, Jataware has written a helper tool that allows execution of .xlsx files with the ability to define variables which can be set during Dojo model runs.


## excel-model-runner

This tool is **[excel-model-runner](https://github.com/dojo-modeling/excel-model-runner)**. This tool is included in the `Ubuntu-Analytics` image, or can be manually included from [the Github page](https://github.com/dojo-modeling/excel-model-runner).
